//	"healthboost" - The amount of extra HP each zombie will get in addition to that zombie's initial health
//	"respawn" - If enabled, all zombies will be immediately respawn after death, when the day kill limit is
//	          - reached, the remaining zombies dig into the ground and the next day will begin
